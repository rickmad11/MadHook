# MadHook

This is a basic hooking library that has not been tested in any real applications or cheats yet. 
The library will be expanded as needed, with new features or support added whenever I encounter issues in my own projects which use this Library.

The way for initializing and creating hooks is inspired by the good old Minhook library.

Examples can be found in the Test Project Folder -> Test.cpp
